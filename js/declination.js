// Magnetic declination from the World Magnetic Model 2025 (NOAA NCEI / BGS; valid Nov 2024 – Nov 2029).
// iOS reports the compass against magnetic north; the sky needs true north, which differs by the declination
// (about −11° in Peterborough, up to 20°+ elsewhere). Coefficients from the official WMM2025 file (via the
// geomagnetism npm package, Apache-2.0); checked against NOAA's test values to within 0.005°.
